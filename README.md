#Redux App

<p>This is a simple app that has input fields and a button that add an item's title, description, and
image url to display. </p>

<p>Each item has a delete button that allows for deleting that item. This project was made to demonstrate my understanding of react redux. My skills in creating components, reducers, action creator, actions, stores and states were put into action.</p>

<p>More actions will be added soon!</p>
